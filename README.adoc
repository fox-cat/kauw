kauw is an expiremental tiling window manager built for x11 using nim
currently it is very minimal, but more features are planned/ hoped for

.goals (・・；)
****
i have a few goals in mind while working on this project
* be written and configured entirely in {1}[nim]
* be easily configurable
* be easily hackable
* be fairly small and minimalist
* help myself learn and get around x11
****

.(。ヘ°) configuration
****
the default configuration file is {2}[`config.def.nim`]
duplicate it and rename it to `config.nim`, and you can configure it from there
